## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

Build out for mobile first, account for desktop through media queries, and add the interactive elements at the end. Complete the challenge with a refactor and testing.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox

### What I learned

How to apply an interactive overlay to an image with ::before and ::after pseudo elements in combination with :hover and :focus pseudo classes.

### Continued development

After experimenting with overlays I plan to learn more about how to make use of ::before and ::after as well as the :focus-visible pseudo class.
